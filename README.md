## What is a websocket?
WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. The protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.

## What is STOMP?
Simple (or Streaming) Text Oriented Message Protocol (STOMP), formerly known as TTMP, is a simple text-based protocol, designed for working with message-oriented middleware (MOM). It provides an interoperable wire format that allows STOMP clients to talk with any message broker supporting the protocol.

Since websocket is just a communication protocol, it doesnâ€™t know how to send a message to a particular user. STOMP is basically a messaging protocol which is useful for these functionalities.
